Lab 1 for Web Design
## What is a website and how is it different from a web application?
A website is a collection of pages that share information, images, or content that users can simply view or read. A web application, on the other hand, is interactive — users can log in, submit forms, or perform actions that update data. In short, a website mainly shows information, while a web application lets users do things.
## Why do organizations need websites?
Organizations need websites to reach more people and share updates or important information easily. For example, schools can post announcements, enrollment details, and contact info online so students don’t always need to visit in person. It also helps build credibility and makes communication more convenient.
## What challenges did you encounter while creating your first repository?
At first, I was confused about where to start because GitHub looked a bit intimidating. I had to figure out what a repository really means, where to put the README file, and whether I needed to add other files like .gitignore or a license. But after exploring and following the steps carefully, I started to understand how it works. It feels rewarding now that I can create one on my own.
## How might the practice of documentation (README) help in future projects?
Writing a README helps me explain what my project is about, so anyone viewing it — including me in the future — can quickly understand its purpose. It also makes projects look more professional and organized. In future web projects, having proper documentation will save time and make collaboration easier.
